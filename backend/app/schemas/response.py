"""Response envelopes (PRD §85/§96) — every endpoint returns one of these shapes.

OCR and Speech success responses flatten their fields alongside ``success``
rather than nesting them under a ``data`` key (see the concrete examples in
PRD §79/§83) — the generic ``{success, data, message}`` wrapper in §85 is the
abstract shape; these models are its concrete, per-endpoint instantiations.
